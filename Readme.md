## üìå Project Title

**CyberSage v2.0 - AI-Powered Real-Time Vulnerability Intelligence Platform for Modern Web Applications**

---

## üìã Project Summary

CyberSage v2.0 is an **advanced, AI-enhanced security scanning platform** that revolutionizes vulnerability detection through **real-time analysis, attack chain identification, and intelligent remediation recommendations**. Unlike traditional scanners that simply list vulnerabilities, CyberSage correlates findings to detect **multi-step attack paths**, analyzes **business logic flaws**, and provides **context-aware security insights** powered by artificial intelligence.

The platform addresses critical gaps in modern cybersecurity tools by combining **comprehensive vulnerability detection** (XSS, SQLi, IDOR, SSRF) with **advanced threat intelligence** capabilities including race condition detection, API security testing, and automated exploitation path analysis. Built with a **WebSocket-powered real-time interface**, security researchers can monitor scan progress, receive instant vulnerability notifications, and visualize attack surfaces as discoveries happen‚Äîeliminating the traditional "scan and wait" bottleneck.

**Key Innovation:** CyberSage's **Attack Chain Detection Engine** automatically identifies when multiple individual vulnerabilities combine to create critical exploitation paths, prioritizing remediation efforts based on actual risk rather than theoretical severity scores.

## üéØ Project Description

### Problem Statement

Modern web applications face increasingly sophisticated attacks, yet traditional vulnerability scanners operate in isolation‚Äîdetecting individual flaws without understanding how attackers chain them together. Security teams struggle with:

- **False Positive Overload:** 40-60% of scanner findings require manual verification
- **Missing Context:** No understanding of how vulnerabilities combine into attack paths
- **Business Logic Blindness:** Automated tools miss application-specific flaws like race conditions and price manipulation
- **Static Analysis:** No real-time feedback during security assessments
- **AI Gap:** Lack of intelligent analysis to prioritize remediation efforts

### Solution Architecture

CyberSage v2.0 introduces a **three-layer intelligent scanning architecture**:

**1. Core Detection Layer**
- **Advanced Crawling Engine:** Discovers subdomains, live hosts, endpoints, and technology stacks
- **Comprehensive Vulnerability Scanner:** Detects XSS, SQL Injection, IDOR, CSRF, security misconfigurations, and sensitive file exposure
- **API Security Module:** Tests REST/GraphQL endpoints for authentication bypass, mass assignment, and rate limiting issues

**2. Advanced Intelligence Layer**
- **Attack Chain Detector:** Identifies multi-step exploitation paths (e.g., XSS ‚Üí Cookie Theft ‚Üí Session Hijacking)
- **Business Logic Scanner:** Tests for race conditions, price manipulation, authentication flow bypasses, and parameter tampering
- **Second-Order Vulnerability Detection:** Tracks payloads across application flows to find delayed-execution vulnerabilities

**3. AI Analysis Layer**
- **Machine Learning-Based False Positive Filtering:** Validates findings using behavioral analysis
- **Context-Aware Risk Scoring:** Adjusts severity based on actual exploitability and business impact
- **Automated Remediation Recommendations:** Provides specific, actionable fix guidance powered by OpenRouter API integration

### Technical Innovation

**Real-Time WebSocket Architecture:** Unlike batch-processing scanners, CyberSage streams findings instantly through WebSocket connections, providing live progress updates, vulnerability notifications, and tool activity monitoring.

**Confidence Scoring System:** Every finding includes a confidence score (0-100%) based on multi-tool correlation, proof-of-concept generation, and AI validation‚Äîhelping security teams prioritize manual verification efforts.

**Modular Design:** Plugin-based architecture allows easy integration of custom scanners and detection modules, making the platform extensible for organization-specific security requirements.

### Target Users & Use Cases

- **Security Researchers:** Comprehensive reconnaissance and vulnerability assessment
- **Penetration Testers:** Automated initial scanning with advanced manual testing support
- **Development Teams:** Continuous security testing in CI/CD pipelines
- **Bug Bounty Hunters:** Fast, accurate vulnerability discovery with chain detection
- **Small Security Teams:** Enterprise-grade scanning without enterprise costs

### Expected Impact

- **60% Reduction** in false positive investigation time through AI validation
- **3x Faster** vulnerability discovery via real-time parallel scanning
- **Critical Risk Prioritization** by identifying exploitable attack chains
- **Improved Security Posture** through context-aware, actionable recommendations

### Technology Stack

- **Backend:** Python (Flask, SocketIO) for real-time communication
- **Frontend:** React with Tailwind CSS for modern, responsive UI
- **Database:** SQLite for efficient scan result storage
- **AI Integration:** OpenRouter API for GPT-powered analysis
- **Security Tools:** Integration with Subfinder, Nuclei, SQLMap, and custom modules
